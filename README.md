ABC Company E-Shop Database Project

Introduction:
Welcome to the ABC Company E-Shop Database Project! This project is focused on designing and developing a comprehensive database schema for an e-commerce company called ABC Company, which sells products across Europe. The main objective is to create a robust and efficient database system using MySQL to manage various aspects of the online shop, including customers, products, orders, and suppliers.

Key Features:
* Comprehensive Database Schema: The database schema includes several key entities such as categories, customers, products, suppliers, orders, order items, returned orders, and returned products.
* Normalization: The database is normalized to the third normal form (3NF) to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity.
* Entity Relationships: Clearly defined relationships between entities, including primary and foreign keys.
* Sample Queries: A set of sample queries to demonstrate how to retrieve meaningful information from the database.

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to create a well-structured and normalized database that supports the operations of ABC Company's e-commerce platform. This database will help manage customer information, product catalog, order processing, and inventory tracking efficiently, providing a solid foundation for data-driven decision-making.
